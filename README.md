The games.log file is generated by the quake 3 arena server. It records all the information of games when a game starts, when it ends, who killed whom, who died because he fell flat, who died bruised, among others.
The parser is able to read the file and group the data in each game.

Just run it in your console
```
  ruby parser_log.rb
```
